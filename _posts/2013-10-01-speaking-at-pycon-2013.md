<h1>I'll be at PyconDE 2013 in Cologne</h1>
<p>
I submitted a talk with one of my YADT developer colleagues.
He is a developer with a strong operations background while I am a developer with a strong QA background, which will (hopefully)
make for an interesting presentation.
We'll be talking about continuous integration with the <a href="http://pybuilder.github.io">pybuilder toolchain</a>.

We use pybuilder for nearly everything we do in python and it's been a great asset so far.<br/>
The added value from having something in place that orchestrates all the CI parts (coverage, linting, unit/integration testing, packaging),
along with very sane defaults, keeps us productive and focused on the real work -
delivering business value and getting sh** done - instead of reinventing the wheel.

I'm looking forward to a great conference, I was in Leipzig last year and they had
great keynotes as well as interesting talk topics. I personally thought that 20 minutes
was too short a timeframe to dive into any topic but this year there are also many 1-hour talks!
