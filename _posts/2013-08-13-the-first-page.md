<h2>The first page&trade;</h2>
<p>
I finally decided that I want to have a blog, but the usual blogging platforms
are too bloated (and not extensible enough when you need it) for my taste.<br/>
Thus my decision to roll with <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-with-pages">GitHub pages</a>
(powered by <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>).<br/>

<h3>Why Jekyll and not another wordpress/blogger blog?</h3>
Jekyll is simple but powerful, can run on any server (or locally) and I get to write
my posts in sublime text, not some overloaded ajax interface.
I also have a nice history of the blog (due to using git), and you can fix typos by submitting a pull request.
Awesome, right?

I pondered about serving a static site for a while because it makes things
like commenting difficult, but that's where services like <a href="http://disqus.com">Disqus</a> really shine.

<h3>Topics</h3>
<p>
I'll be blogging about just about anything, with a special focus on programming,
data centers and Python, since that's how I make a living.
